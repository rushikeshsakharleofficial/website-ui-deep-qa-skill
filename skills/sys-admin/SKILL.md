# Sys Admin

## Overview

Testing skill router. Use when domain is ambiguous or multiple domains apply. For a single clear domain, go directly to that subskill — skipping this router is correct.

## When to Use This Skill vs Going Direct

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Test our checkout page" — clearly UI | Go direct: `website-ui-deep-qa` |
| "Audit our database layer" — clearly SQL | Go direct: `sql-deep-qa` |
| "Full audit — UI, DB, and security" — multiple domains | Use this router first |
| "Test our app" — domain unclear | Use this router to pick the right subskill |
| "Run backend contract tests" — no backend subskill yet | Use this router, note gap |

## Domain Map

| Domain | Subskill | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Website / web app — layout, a11y, forms, network, security, responsive, SEO, CSRF, auth, flow bypass, 46 helpers | `website-ui-deep-qa` | ✅ Active |
| SQL database — schema, injection, indexes, migrations, ORM, multi-tenant isolation, credentials, backup | `sql-deep-qa` | ✅ Active |
| Backend REST/GraphQL, API contracts, rate limits | — | Planned |
| Security deep dive — OWASP, dep CVEs, injection | — | Planned (partial: `website-ui-deep-qa` covers DOM security, headers, CSRF, auth) |
| Test quality — coverage, flaky tests, mutation | — | Planned |
| Backtesting — strategy, P&L, lookahead bias | — | Planned |
| User experience — flows, drop-off, rage clicks | — | Planned |
| Frontend components — contracts, render regression | — | Planned |
| Deploy & infra — env hygiene, secrets in CI | — | Planned |
| API — correctness, OWASP security, performance, response quality, URL hygiene, contracts | `api-deep-qa` | ✅ Active |
| Task tracking — smart todo list, real-time status updates, blockers | `smart-todo` | ✅ Active |

## Active Subskill: UI / Web App

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `website-ui-deep-qa`

Invoke as: `/sys-admin:website-ui-deep-qa <user request or URL>`

Covers 46 helper categories. Supports Playwright MCP (live), Playwright Test (automated), source-code inspection.

## Active Subskill: SQL / Database

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `sql-deep-qa`

Invoke as: `/sys-admin:sql-deep-qa <repo path or DB connection>`

Covers 12 check categories: injection, schema, indexes, performance, migrations, connections, sensitive data, access control, credentials, ORM patterns, backup, transactions.

## Active Subskill: Smart Todo

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `smart-todo`

Invoke as: `/sys-admin:smart-todo`

Use at the start of any multi-step task. Decomposes work into a tracked list, updates status in real time, surfaces blockers, reports completion summary.

## Active Subskill: API Deep QA

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `api-deep-qa`

Invoke as: `/sys-admin:api-deep-qa <base URL or repo path>`

Covers 6 domains: endpoint correctness, OWASP API Top 10 security, performance/speed, response quality/tuning, URL structure/hygiene, contract integrity.

**Partial coverage for planned domains:** DOM security, response leak scanning, CSRF, auth surface, network headers, and cookie audits are already in `website-ui-deep-qa`. For a deep security-only audit, note the gap and use what's available.
