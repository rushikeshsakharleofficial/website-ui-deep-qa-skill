name: sys-admin
description: Use when the testing domain is unclear, multiple domains apply at once, or the request contains mixed signals — UI + SQL + API + security together. Also use when the user says "audit everything", "test our app", or does not name a specific domain. For a single clearly-named domain, go direct to that subskill instead.

# Sys Admin — Smart Router

## Core rule

**Read the request. Match keywords. Pick subskills. Dispatch in order.**

Never guess. Never skip. If two domains are mentioned, run both subskills.

---

## Step 1 — Keyword extraction

Scan the user's request for trigger words. Each word maps to a subskill.

### Keyword → subskill map

| User says any of these... | Route to |
|---------------------------|----------|
| page, website, web app, frontend, UI, layout, button, form, modal, navbar, sidebar, responsive, mobile, desktop, a11y, accessibility, SEO, Playwright, screenshot, CSS, HTML, click, hover, scroll, rendering, visual, component, breakpoint, cookie banner, toast, drawer, carousel | `website-ui-deep-qa` |
| database, DB, SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL, schema, migration, ORM, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, ActiveRecord, TypeORM, GORM, Sequelize, Drizzle, Hibernate, query, index, table, column, foreign key, constraint, stored procedure, transaction, N+1, connection pool, backup, tenant isolation, RLS, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, NoSQL, pg_hba.conf, pgaudit, pg_stat_statements, bloat, EXPLAIN, orphaned, compliance, PCI, HIPAA, SOC2, bcrypt, argon2, encryption at rest | `sql-deep-qa` |
| API, endpoint, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, HTTP, request, response, status code, JSON, JWT, token, rate limit, CORS, webhook, OpenAPI, Swagger, route, controller, payload, headers, auth, IDOR, BOLA, rate limiting, injection, fuzzing, contract, Pact, k6, Artillery | `api-deep-qa` |
| plan, track, todo, checklist, steps, list, organize, manage tasks, what's left, progress | `smart-todo` |

---

## Step 2 — Domain count decision

```
Count distinct domains matched:

0 domains → Ask one clarifying question (see Step 5)
1 domain  → Dispatch that subskill directly
2+ domains → Multi-domain dispatch (see Step 3)
```

---

## Step 3 — Multi-domain dispatch order

When multiple subskills are needed, always run in this order:

```
1. smart-todo      ← ALWAYS FIRST if task has 3+ steps (mandatory)
2. sql-deep-qa     ← security/data risk highest; run before UI
3. api-deep-qa     ← API surface before UI layer
4. website-ui-deep-qa  ← UI/frontend last
```

**Rationale:** Data and API vulnerabilities are higher severity than UI defects. Fix the foundation before the surface.

Example multi-domain dispatch:

```
Request: "Full audit of our checkout — the page, the API, and the database"

Dispatch order:
  1. /sys-admin:smart-todo        ← track the full audit
  2. /sys-admin:sql-deep-qa       ← DB layer: injection, schema, indexes, tenant isolation
  3. /sys-admin:api-deep-qa       ← API layer: OWASP, JWT, rate limiting, contracts
  4. /sys-admin:website-ui-deep-qa ← UI layer: layout, forms, a11y, network, security headers
```

---

## Step 4 — Signal patterns (beyond keywords)

Some requests don't use exact keywords. Recognize these patterns:

| Pattern | Route to |
|---------|----------|
| URL provided (`http://`, `https://`, `localhost:`) | `website-ui-deep-qa` first; if API endpoints visible also `api-deep-qa` |
| Repo path provided (`./src`, `/app`, `~/project`) | Inspect structure → route by what's found |
| "It looks broken" / "something is wrong" | Ask one question: UI, API, or DB? |
| "Is it secure?" / "security audit" | All three: `sql-deep-qa` + `api-deep-qa` + `website-ui-deep-qa` |
| "Is it fast?" / "why is it slow?" | `api-deep-qa` (Check 3 + 13) + `sql-deep-qa` (Check 4) |
| "Does it work?" / "test everything" | All three in order |
| "AI generated this" / "Cursor/v0/Bolt built this" | All three — AI-generated code commonly has issues in all layers |
| "Pre-deploy review" / "before we ship" | All three + `smart-todo` to track findings |
| "Database migration" | `sql-deep-qa` only (Check 5) |
| "API is returning wrong data" | `api-deep-qa` (Check 1, 4) + `sql-deep-qa` (Check 3, 4) |
| "Login is broken" | `api-deep-qa` (Check 2, 7) + `website-ui-deep-qa` (auth section) |
| "Slow queries" | `sql-deep-qa` (Check 3, 4) only |
| "CORS error" | `api-deep-qa` (Check 2, security misconfiguration) |
| "Page layout broken" | `website-ui-deep-qa` only |
| "Form not submitting" | `website-ui-deep-qa` (forms) + `api-deep-qa` (Check 1) |

---

## Step 5 — Clarifying question (0 domains matched)

If no domain keyword is found, ask **one** question only:

```
"What layer should I audit?
  A) Website / UI (pages, forms, layout, accessibility)
  B) Database (schema, queries, migrations, security)
  C) API (endpoints, auth, performance, security)
  D) All of the above"
```

Do not ask multiple questions. Do not start work until the answer is received.

---

## Step 6 — smart-todo auto-activation rule

**smart-todo activates automatically when any of these are true:**
- Dispatching 2+ subskills (always 3+ steps)
- Single subskill but the request implies multiple checks
- User says "audit", "review", "test everything", "full check"
- Task will produce a multi-section report

When smart-todo activates:
1. Create the master todo list FIRST
2. Add one `[P1]` item per subskill to dispatch
3. Add `[P1]` items for each major check category
4. Add `[P2]` items for report writing, reviewing findings, prioritizing defects

## Domain map

| Domain | Subskill | Checks | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Website / web app | `website-ui-deep-qa` | 46 helpers: layout, a11y, forms, network, security, responsive, SEO, CSRF, auth, flow bypass | ✅ Active |
| SQL / database | `sql-deep-qa` | 17 categories: injection (all types + sqlmap), schema, indexes, performance (pg_stat_statements, bloat), migrations (lock analysis), connections, sensitive data, access control, credentials, ORM (6 ORMs), backup, transactions, DB config security, audit logging, data integrity, NoSQL injection, privilege testing | ✅ Active |
| REST / GraphQL / gRPC API | `api-deep-qa` | 18 categories: correctness, OWASP Top 10, JWT/OAuth2, GraphQL, gRPC, webhooks, rate limit bypass, fuzzing, load testing, contract testing, HTTP/2-3, observability | ✅ Active |
| Task tracking | `smart-todo` | Mandatory for 3+ step tasks: decompose, track, update, surface blockers | ✅ Active (auto) |
| Backend contracts, REST rate limits | — | — | Planned |
| Security deep dive (OWASP, CVEs, dep scan) | — | — | Planned |
| Test quality (coverage, flaky, mutation) | — | — | Planned |
| Frontend components (render regression) | — | — | Planned |
| Deploy & infra (env hygiene, secrets in CI) | — | — | Planned |

## Worked examples

### Example A: single domain, clear

```
Request: "Test the login page on http://localhost:3000/login"
Keywords: "page", URL with path
Domain count: 1 → website-ui-deep-qa

Dispatch:
  /sys-admin:website-ui-deep-qa http://localhost:3000/login
```

### Example B: single domain, implicit

```
Request: "Our N+1 queries are killing performance"
Keywords: "N+1", "queries", "performance"
Domain count: 1 → sql-deep-qa

Dispatch:
  /sys-admin:sql-deep-qa ./src
```

### Example C: two domains

```
Request: "Audit our REST API and check if the database queries are safe"
Keywords: "REST API" → api-deep-qa, "database queries" → sql-deep-qa
Domain count: 2 → multi-domain

Dispatch order:
  1. /sys-admin:smart-todo      ← track multi-domain audit
  2. /sys-admin:sql-deep-qa     ← DB first (higher severity)
  3. /sys-admin:api-deep-qa     ← API second
```

### Example D: all domains

```
Request: "Full security audit before we ship — AI built this with Cursor"
Keywords: "security audit", "AI built" → all domains
Domain count: 3 → full stack

Dispatch order:
  1. /sys-admin:smart-todo
  2. /sys-admin:sql-deep-qa
  3. /sys-admin:api-deep-qa
  4. /sys-admin:website-ui-deep-qa
```

### Example E: no keywords

```
Request: "Something feels off with our app"
Keywords: none matched
Domain count: 0 → ask

Response:
  "What layer should I audit?
    A) Website / UI   B) Database   C) API   D) All of the above"
```

### Example F: implicit all-domains signal

```
Request: "Is this safe to deploy?"
Pattern match: "pre-deploy review"
Domain count: all → full stack

Dispatch order:
  1. /sys-admin:smart-todo
  2. /sys-admin:sql-deep-qa
  3. /sys-admin:api-deep-qa
  4. /sys-admin:website-ui-deep-qa
```

## Anti-patterns — never do these

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Pick one subskill when two keywords appear | Run both in dispatch order |
| Ask multiple clarifying questions | Ask exactly one question with A/B/C/D |
| Start work before smart-todo on multi-domain | smart-todo ALWAYS first |
| Route "is it secure?" to only website-ui-deep-qa | Security = all three layers |
| Ignore "AI generated" signal | AI-generated code = assume all-domain issues |
| Skip smart-todo because "it's just a quick audit" | 3+ steps → smart-todo. No exceptions. |
